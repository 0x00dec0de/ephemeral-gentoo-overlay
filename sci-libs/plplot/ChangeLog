  26 Mar 2008; Joshua Rich <joshua@mso.anu.edu.au> ChangeLog:
  Tested gnome bindings (gcw driver and plplot canvas).  Removed some
  	unneeded patches and replaced with simple sed commands in the
  	ebuild itself.  Some consolidating of the dependencies.

  25 Mar 2008; Joshua Rich <joshua@mso.anu.edu.au> ChangeLog:
  Patched to build wxwindows drivers successfully.  Also tested Java
  	bindings (working).

  19 Mar 2008; Joshua Rich <joshua@mso.anu.edu.au> ChangeLog:
  I had to write some dirty dirty patches to get plplot to find, build
  and link against freetype.  Most of the inspiration and success comes
  from a random Google search that turned up a FindFreeType.cmake module
  file which is part of the FlowVR project, which instead of searching
  for freetype header files just used the output of the command
  freetype-config.  The other parts of the patches are my dirty hacks
  being a complete novice with cmake.

  16 Mar 2008; Joshua Rich <joshua@mso.anu.edu.au> ChangeLog:
  Initial work on creating a plplot ebuild.  plplot-5.8.0-r1.ebuild
  	compiles, installs and all drivers I've tested work.  But it still
  	needs a lot of work.  See bug #204524.
