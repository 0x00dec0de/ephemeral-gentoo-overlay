  26 May 2008; Joshua Rich <joshua@mso.anu.edu.au> ChangeLog:
  Use -O1 optimisation level as -O2 and higher lead to excessive memeory
  	consumption when compiling main program.  Linking part of compile
  	now respects LDFLAGS.  Use -j1 as -j3 on a dual-core machine
  	fails.  Added directFB as dependency.

  17 May 2008; Joshua Rich <joshua@mso.anu.edu.au> ChangeLog:
