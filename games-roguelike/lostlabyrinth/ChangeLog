  11 Jun 2008; Joshua Rich <joshua@mso.anu.edu.au> ChangeLog:
  Add 'live' ebuild of lostlabyrinth as currently the only way to get the
  	game is through the subversion repository.  The live ebuild also
  	supersedes all previous versions because of this, so they have
  	been removed.

  26 May 2008; Joshua Rich <joshua@mso.anu.edu.au> ChangeLog:
  Use -O1 optimisation level as -O2 and higher lead to excessive memeory
  	consumption when compiling main program.  Linking part of compile
  	now respects LDFLAGS.  Use -j1 as -j3 on a dual-core machine
  	fails.  Added directFB as dependency.

  17 May 2008; Joshua Rich <joshua@mso.anu.edu.au> ChangeLog:
  Initial ebuild.
