Hello,

this patch adds support for version 1.2 of the last.fm notification
protocol to qlscrobbler, including support for now playing
notifications. Moreover, some issues with the code like == checks with
booleans were fixed.

Cheers,
    Franz

Hey folks,

So, I was getting tired of wondering why sometimes songs just wouldn't
get submitted with the qlscrobbler plugin, so I dived into the code
and fixed things:
- A song would not get submitted if it was paused/unpaused at all.
- Seeking in a track now behaves properly; it makes no difference as
long as it has been playing for length / 2.
- Added some things to make logging more informative and other little things...

This is on top of the previously posted protocol v1.2 patch. Attached
is a cumulative patch against svn r4178. I've tested things pretty
thoroughly, and I think I've squashed all the bugs. Please try it out
and give feedback if necessary!
