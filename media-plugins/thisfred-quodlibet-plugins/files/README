There are three plugins for now, in order of increasing complexity and
interest:

1. autosearch.py

Very simple plugin, searches for the title of the current song in your
library: Good for getting rid of duplicates, and finding possible
covers.

2. lastfmtagger.py

Useful only if you have a last.fm account and make use of tags
there. This will synchronize last.fm tags both ways, saving them in a
custom 'tag' id3 field in your local files. Since Quod Libet has a
great id3 editing interface (Ex Falso, also usable as a stand alone
application,) this makes adding and editing tags to songs, artists and
albums on last.fm much easier.

3. autoqueue.py

This gets similar tracks to the ones you play from last.fm and puts
them in the queue. It is smart enough not to play the same
artists/songs for a configurable time, and has some other options. It
works pretty well in creating a consistent yet not wholly predictable
listening experience if you have a large and diverse library.

My underlying reasons for developing these (aside from having fun
hacking) are:

    * I love tagging, and all the emerging properties it gives you for
      free. These are experiments in using freeform tags to structure,
      search and experience my music collection.
    * The reason I can't bear to listen to radio is that the same
      songs seem to come by every hour. I like to be surprised, but I
      also like my listening experience to be somewhat cohesive, so
      I'm always looking for something in the space between
      predictable and random. I mostly don't think genres are enough
      for this.

Let me know if you have questions, or would like to help.
