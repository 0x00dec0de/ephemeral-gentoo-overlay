There are three plugins for now, in order of increasing complexity and
interest:

1. autosearch.py

Very simple plugin, searches for the title of the current song in your
library: Good for getting rid of duplicates, and finding possible
covers.

2. lastfmtagger.py

Useful only if you have a last.fm account and make use of tags
there. This will synchronize last.fm tags both ways, saving them in a
custom 'tag' id3 field in your local files. Since Quod Libet has a
great id3 editing interface (Ex Falso, also usable as a stand alone
application,) this makes adding and editing tags to songs, artists and
albums on last.fm much easier.

My underlying reasons for developing these (aside from having fun
hacking) are:

    * I love tagging, and all the emerging properties it gives you for
      free. These are experiments in using freeform tags to structure,
      search and experience my music collection.
    * The reason I can't bear to listen to radio is that the same
      songs seem to come by every hour. I like to be surprised, but I
      also like my listening experience to be somewhat cohesive, so
      I'm always looking for something in the space between
      predictable and random. I mostly don't think genres are enough
      for this.

Let me know if you have questions, or would like to help.
