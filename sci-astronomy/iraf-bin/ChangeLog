  22 Oct 2007; Joshua Rich <joshua@mso.anu.edu.au> ChangeLog:
  src_unpack now uses 'unpack' for everything.  Added env.d file for IRAF.

  20 Oct 2007; Joshua Rich <joshua@mso.anu.edu.au> ChangeLog:
  Massive re-write.  src_unpack/compile functions are now used correctly
  	(i.e. source is unpacked in src_unpack as opposed to
  	src_install). Simplified some of the steps as well.

  19 Aug 2007; Joshua Rich <joshua@mso.anu.edu.au> ChangeLog:
  Created ebuild for 2.13 beta, works
