  25 Sep 2007; Joshua Rich <joshua@mso.anu.edu.au> ChangeLog:
  Fixed convert binary to avoid conflict with media-gfx/imagemagick and
  	changed categories on desktop entries

  26 Aug 2007; Joshua Rich <joshua@mso.anu.edu.au> ChangeLog:
  Karma now installs into /usr like a normal application.  Fixed desktop
  entry files as well.

  19 Aug 2007; Joshua Rich <joshua@mso.anu.edu.au> ChangeLog:
  Cleaned up ebuild again.  Much simpler now.

  09 Jul 2007; Joshua Rich joshua@mso.anu.edu.au
  Clean-up of ebuild.

  21 Mar 2007; joshua joshua@mso.anu.edu.au
  Complete rewrite of ebuild.
  All installation and unpacking now done inside pkg_install.  This ebuild
  does many things it probably shouldn't do, namely because the way
  karma does things is very non-standard.  This ebuild basically
  installs everything under /opt/karma except docs, which are
  installed in the normal place.
