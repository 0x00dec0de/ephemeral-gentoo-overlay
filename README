== INTRODUCTION

So for some time now I have been using Gentoo Linux, and trying to be
a good Gentoo user, I’ve created some unofficial, possibly buggy, but
generally usable ‘ebuilds‘ for various astronomy software and other
software packages I use.  They can be found in this overlay.

== USING THIS OVERLAY

You can use this overlay with layman (app-portage/layman). To add the
overlay, edit the file /etc/layman/layman.cfg and add the following
url:

http://github.com/joshuar/ephemeral-gentoo-overlay/tree/master%2Foverlay.xml?raw=true

..to the “overlays:” section. Then re-sync all overlays (layman -S)
and add this overlay (layman -a ephemeral). Hopefully that worked ok.

== FEEDBACK

I love feedback, but I get none.  So if you use this overlay, why not
send me a quick email with some comments.  Maybe just say hi.  Got a
problem with an ebuild from this overlay, tell me, otherwise I might
not know about it. Cheers!

== CONTRIBUTING

Want to help with the packages in this overlay?  Want to add updated
or fixed ebuilds?  Send me an email, I'll gladly allow contributers.
