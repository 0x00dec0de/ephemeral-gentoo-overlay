== INTRODUCTION

So for some time now I have been using Gentoo Linux, and trying to be
a good Gentoo user, I’ve created some unofficial, possibly buggy, but generally
usable ‘ebuilds‘ for various astronomy software and other software packages
I use.  They can be found in this overlay.

== USING THIS OVERLAY

You can use this overlay with layman (app-portage/layman). To add the
overlay, edit the file /etc/layman/layman.cfg and add the following
url:

http://github.com/joshuar/ephemeral-gentoo-overlay/tree/master%2Foverlay.xml?raw=true

..to the “overlays:” section. Then re-sync all overlays (layman -S) and
add this overlay (layman -a ephemeral). Hopefully that worked
ok. 

== FEEDBACK

I love feedback, but I get none.  So if you use this overlay, why not
send me a quick email with some comments.  Maybe just say hi.  Got a problem with an ebuild
from this overlay, tell me, otherwise I might not know about
it. Cheers!

== CONTRIBUTING

Want to help with the packages in this overlay?  Want to add updated
or fixed ebuilds?  Send me an email, I'll gladly allow contributers.

== NOTES ABOUT THIS OVERLAY

- Some packages will be `masked’ as I may not have tested them much
  (or may feel they aren’t stable). But they are generally usable. You
  should read the guide on the Gentoo User Wiki on dealing with masked
  packages. Basically, you’ll need to add them to your
  /etc/portage/package.use file. 

== WHAT PACKAGES/PROGRAMS ARE AVAILABLE?

See the PACKAGES-DESCRIPTIONS file in the (hopefully) same place as
this file.
