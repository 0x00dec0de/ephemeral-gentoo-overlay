== INTRODUCTION

So for some time now I have been using Gentoo Linux, and trying to be
a good Gentoo user, I’ve created some unofficial, possibly buggy, but
generally usable ‘ebuilds‘ for various programs I use.  Some of the
programs in this overlay include live versions of QuodLibet media
player, various roguelike games,a few niche multimedia apps, some
gtk+/xcursor/icon themes and a few random X11 apps.
 
== REQUIREMENTS

- This overlay requires a version of portage that is EAPI 2 compatible.
- You will also need to enable to following overlays to use ebuilds from this
  overlay:
    * gnome
    * sunrise

== INSTALL

You can use this overlay with layman (app-portage/layman). To add the
overlay, edit the file /etc/layman/layman.cfg and add the following
url:

http://github.com/joshuar/ephemeral-gentoo-overlay/blob/master/overlay.xml

..to the “overlays:” section. Then re-sync all overlays (layman -S)
and add this overlay (layman -a ephemeral). Hopefully that worked ok.

== FEEDBACK

I love feedback, but I get none.  So if you use this overlay, why not
send me a quick email with some comments.  Maybe just say hi.  Got a
problem with an ebuild from this overlay, tell me, otherwise I might
not know about it. Cheers!

== CONTRIBUTING

Want to help with the packages in this overlay?  Want to add updated
or fixed ebuilds?  Send me an email, I'll gladly allow contributers.
