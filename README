So for some time now I have been using Gentoo Linux, and trying to be
a good Gentoo user, I’ve created some unofficial, possibly buggy, but generally
usable ‘ebuilds‘ for various astronomy software and other software packages
I use.  They can be found in this overlay.

You can use this overlay with layman (app-portage/layman). To add the
overlay, edit the file /etc/layman/layman.cfg and add the following
url:

http://github.com/joshuar/ephemeral-gentoo-overlay/tree/master%2Foverlay.xml?raw=true

..to the “overlays:” section. Then re-sync all overlays (layman -S) and
add this overlay (layman -a ephemeral). Hopefully that worked
ok. 

Bugs and problems can be sent to my email listed in my profile on
GitHub.  I'm generally responsive, I usually answer within a week.

Notes:

- I only own x86 hardware, so I’ve only `keyworded ‘ these ebuilds for
  x86 machines. That means if you are using some other hardware
  platform (ppc, x86_64, sparc), portage will complain when trying to
  use these ebuilds. If you’d still like to use the packages, then
  just contact me and I’ll adjust the ebuilds, but I make even less
  guarantees of stability/safety than using these ebuilds on x86
  hardware. 

- Some packages will be `masked’ as I may not have tested them much
  (or may feel they aren’t stable). But they are generally usable. You
  should read the guide on the Gentoo User Wiki on dealing with masked
  packages. Basically, you’ll need to add them to your
  /etc/portage/package.use file.
