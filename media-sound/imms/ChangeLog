  Missing call the python_version in src_install when installing quodlibet
  plugin.

  03 Apr 2008; Joshua Rich <joshua.rich@gmail.com> ChangeLog:
  Wrapped python part of postinst and postrm functions in conditional USE
  	flag code as the commands are only relevant if the USE flag
  	quodlibet is set.

  03 Apr 2008; Joshua Rich <joshua@mso.anu.edu.au> ChangeLog:
  Fixed problem with having the analyzer and remote USE flags unset.  This
  	would cause configure to be unable to find glib, fix was to
  	explicitly call PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG in configure.ac.  Also added
  	new use flag 'quodlibet' to enable fetching and installing of the
  	quodlibet imms plugin.

  29 Nov 2007; Joshua Rich <joshua@mso.anu.edu.au> ChangeLog:
  Added patch to rules.mk file to fix problem with binary data included as

  	architecture (using the -B option to objcopy) to overcome
  	'architecture unknown' errors on compile.
