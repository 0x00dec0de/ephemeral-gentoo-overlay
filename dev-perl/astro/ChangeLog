  11 Feb 2008; Joshua Rich <joshua@mso.anu.edu.au> ChangeLog:
  Initial ebuild.  Although this is trivial to install via g-cpan (and the
  	ebuild itself is as simple as it gets), g-cpan and portage do not
  	understand that this is a meta-package for three different Perl
  	modules.  Thus I've made this an ebuild to avoid annoying warning
  	messages when using g-cpan and in portage and portage-related tools.
